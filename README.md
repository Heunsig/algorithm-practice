# Algorithm practice

I've been solving algorithm problems, and then updating in Github.

## How to read my codes

1. Enter a folder named an algorithm name.
2. Open index.js
3. On the top side, there is an explanation of what algorithm problem we need to solve and an example.
4. There is a function which I wrote to solve the algorithm problem inside index.js.
